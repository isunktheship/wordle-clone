# AJC WORDLE Clone
*2022's "Hello World"*



### Wat?
Wordle is a web-based word game developed by Josh Wardle. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position.

### Why?
I "cloned" the Wordle App (e.g. recreated it from scratch) after getting completely hooked on the game.  I gave myself a challenge to learn and build a React App within a day, this is the product of that effort.

### Surely this was a simple app to make?
Yes, sort of.  The app contains examples of the following:
 - Event Handling
 - Publish-Subscribe Pattern
 - Array Manipulation
 - Strings & Character Manipulation
 - State Tracking
 - Responsive Design & Styling
 - 3rd Party Library Integration
 - Validation/Testing
